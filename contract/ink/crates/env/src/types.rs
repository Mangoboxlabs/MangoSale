//! Types for the default environment.
//!
//! These are simple mirrored types from the default substrate FRAME configuration.
//! Their interfaces and functionality might not be complete.
//!
//! Users are required to provide their own type definitions and `Environment`
//! implementations in order to write ink! contracts for other chain configurations.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! When authoring a contract, the concrete `Environment` are available via aliases
//! generated by the `lang` macro. Therefore all functionality of the concrete
//! types is accessible in the contract, not constrained by the required trait
//! bounds.
//!
//! Outside the contract and its tests (e.g. in the off-chain environment), where
//! there is no knowledge of the concrete types, the functionality is restricted to
//! the trait bounds on the `Environment` trait types.
