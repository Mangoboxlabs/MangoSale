# MangoSale
MangoBOX labs is committed to the development of the DAO fundraising system, in the hope of developing a complete fundraising system. In the first stage, we developed an Ink! version smart contract of MangoBOX protocol based on Juicebox , which is a well-known project on Ethereum.


However, in the actual process of development, we found some shortcomings of the Juicebox protocol as well : tokens can be issued additionally without restrain, the fundraising rounds are difficult to manage, and overall the protocol is relatively complicated to use. These characteristics are not conducive to the large-scale application of a Web3 product.

After multiple rounds of research by our product team, we decided to conduct a more in-depth exploration in the field of DAO fundraising. We specialized in Ink! Smart contract version of MangoSale Protocol. MangoSale Protocol is a license-free protocol designated for project fair launch, which is considered as an open IDO platform. It is not limited to DAOs, but also applicable to various types of individuals or organizations. Compared to Juicebox, it's simpler and fairer to use. Any project party can raise the funds they want in different ways through the MangoSale Protocol.
